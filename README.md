# Webpack - Overview

Hi Guys, the purpose of this repo is to tell you a brief overview of Webpack. to run an example, you just need to go into the desired folder (example) and run the following command:

`webpack --config webpack.config.js --progress --colors`

And then to see the result, in some of the examples, you just need to run the command:

`node bundle.js`

For some others, you need to run a complete app, please see the `README.md` file inside those folders...
